    "Rarely, if ever, are we able to completely survey a population of interest. Similarly, we will often deal with missing data. Whatever it may be, whether estimating asthma rates, fish populations, daily temperatures, material volumes, risk, manufacturing defects or any other measurement of unknown or large scale quantities, we are unlikely to have complete information of the system in question. As a result, we do our best by taking samples and using these to estimate the corresponding measurements for the complete population, from which we took the sample. These estimates of population parameters are known as point estimates. Interestingly, point estimates of specific parameters of a population have predictable behaviors, in that the point estimates themselves will form specific probability distributions. \n",
