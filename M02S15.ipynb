All rows in a given table must have the same columns, which is something we can easily reproduce when creating a class in Python. The hard part is getting our data from a relational database and storing the data needed in an object to work with it in python. Luckily, we have Object Relational Mappers, or ORMs to take care of the heavy lifting for us!\n",
