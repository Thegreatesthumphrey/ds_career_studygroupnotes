    "### Curse of Dimensionality\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the curse of dimensionality? - more dimensions can increase class separation but after a certain point more features decreases model accuracy due to poor sample space coverage of training data\n",
    "\n",
    "What is sample density/sparsity? How is it related to feature dimensionality? - sparsity and dimensionality are directly proportional, as dimensions increase amount of data needed to have same sample space coverage increases exponentially\n",
    "\n",
    "How is variance related to sparsity? - variance is spread of data for a feature, proportional to sparsity. **PCA tries to answer question of how to retain variance (feature information) in higher dimensional spaces with increased sparsity.** "
